# map GeneticAI

in the map GeneticAI is the newest and best code for the drawing of the ai learning visualisation
the car learns by chosing the best car and mutating it using the a mutationRate and the lerp function

# map DeepNN

in the map DeepNN the window is rescalable, (but the rays won't scale down with it) and it uses backpropagation
to update weights and biases in the neuralnetwork to improve the actions that the car takes.
